            <p>I'm currently a student, but my interest in web development
                started as a hobby. I enjoyed creating websites so much that I<br/>
                decided to turn it into a freelancing career. It's been exciting
                to collaborate with clients to create digital products that meet<br/>
                their needs. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills
                and deliver top-notch results.
            </p>
